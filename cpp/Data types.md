# Data types
In C++, a variable can be converted from one type to another using four casts, one of them being static cast, e.g. ```static_cast<double>(outcomes[j])/trials```

- ```int```: Integer, 4 bytes long
 - ```float```: float
 - ```double```: longer float
 - ```char```: character
 - ```unsigned```: only positive
 - ```long```: use more bytes, can use on ```int``` and ```double```
 - ```short```: use less bytes, can use on ```int```
 - ```void```: no input or output, e.g. ```int main(void)``` means return an *int*, no input arguments
